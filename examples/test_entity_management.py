"""Example tests demonstrating automatic entity cleanup and persistent entities.

This file demonstrates two entity management patterns:

1. Per-test entities via given_an_entity():
   - Created during a test via home_assistant.given_an_entity()
   - Automatically cleaned up after each test
   - Useful for test-specific temporary entities
   - Helps avoid test pollution and cross-test coupling

2. Persistent session entities:
   - Defined in a YAML file (persistent_entities.yaml) referenced via pyproject.toml
   - Registered with Home Assistant during container startup
   - Available throughout the entire test session
   - Never automatically removed
   - Useful for simulating integration-created entities that tests depend on

To use persistent entities:
1. Create a YAML file with entity definitions (see persistent_entities.yaml)
2. Add to your pyproject.toml:
   [tool.pytest.ini_options]
   ha_persistent_entities_path = "path/to/entities.yaml"
