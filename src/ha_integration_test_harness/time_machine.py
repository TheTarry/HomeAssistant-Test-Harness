class TimeMachine:
    """Manages time manipulation for integration tests using libfaketime.

    This class enables deterministic testing of time-based automations by allowing
    tests to advance time forward in the containerized Home Assistant environment.

    **IMPORTANT LIMITATION**: Time can only move forward, never backward. Once time
    has been advanced, it cannot be reset to an earlier point. This is a fundamental
    constraint of the libfaketime implementation used by the containers.

    The TimeMachine is session-scoped, meaning time persists across all tests in a
    test session. Tests that depend on specific time conditions must explicitly
    advance time to the desired state at the start of the test.

        **Timezone behaviour:**
        When the ``TimeMachine`` was constructed with a ``timezone`` (e.g. ``"Europe/London"``),
        ``hour``, ``minute``, and ``second`` are interpreted as **local wall-clock time** in that
        timezone. The internal fake time is always stored and written to the container as naive UTC,
        so the conversion from local time → UTC is handled automatically — callers do not need to
        know whether DST is currently active.

        When no ``timezone`` was configured, ``hour``/``minute``/``second`` are applied as UTC
        (the legacy behaviour).

        **DST edge cases (when timezone is configured):**

        - **Non-existent hour** (spring-forward gap, e.g. ``hour=1, minute=30`` in Europe/London on
          the spring-forward date): ``ValueError`` is raised with a message explaining which hour
          is skipped and on which date.
        - **Ambiguous hour** (fall-back, e.g. ``hour=1, minute=30`` on the fall-back date, which
          occurs twice): the first occurrence (pre-transition, DST) is chosen if it has not yet
          passed; otherwise the second occurrence (post-transition, standard time) is used. This
          ensures the ``jump_to_next`` always lands on the *next* upcoming occurrence of the
          requested local time.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If month/day names are invalid, numeric values are out of range, or the
                requested hour does not exist in the configured timezone on the target date.
